# Chinese Tone Recognition System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to recgonize tones in single Chinese characters. It's an starting project mainly to explore more about various ML libraries and audio processing tools.

## Dataset
For the dataset, I'm using voice packages downloaded from Mozilla Common Voice
    - A small dataset for testing and development
    - A large dataset for improved model accuracy and training

## Tech Stack

### Audio Processing
- **Librosa & Pydub**: Handle audio processing and format conversion

### Data Processing & Analysis
- **numPy**: Provides high performance array operations and mathematical functions for audio processing and feature extraction
- **pandas**: Manages data organization and analysis through DataFrame structures making it easier to handle large datasets for audio files and labels
- **matplotlib**: Visualizes audio data using frequency and intensity graphs
- **tqdm**: Implements progress bars to monitor and compare processing speeds with/without multiprocessing
